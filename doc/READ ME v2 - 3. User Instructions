USER INSTRUCTIONS


**** OVERVIEW *****

PMAC is designed with the intent that it be highly intuitive and easy to use with absolutely no instruction at all. Hopefully this will be the case for most situations, although there is one menu that only the owner can access -- the Edit menu -- that does require detailed instructions for safe use.

**** GENERAL USE -- ANIMATIONS AND GROUPS ****

To use a PMAC object it's as simple as "sit"....that's it!

Just sit on the object and PMAC will position you and play the current animation. If it's in auto mode it will change animations every so often, cycling through the ones that are available based on the currently loaded "animation group". If it isn't in auto mode, or if you want to select animations manually, you'll need to touch the object after you sit on it to get the main controller menu. The first person who touches it will automatically become the "controller".

Only one person can be in control of the menus and they must be seated on the object. If someone else is seated and touches the object, they'll be asked if they want to "take control" away from whoever has it (unless the owner has set it not to allow this). If you take control away from someone else you'll be in charge and the other person will then be along for the ride. Since nobody likes a control war, it's usually a good idea to speak to the current controller before simply grabbing it away from them.

If you've used any other multi-avatar system of this type (like MLP) things will look very familiar to you even though it works in a rather dramatically different way at the script level. An "animation" in PMAC's list is actually a set of animations that are in inventory and get played together for the users that are seated (typically a couple, but PMAC can be set to handle many concurrent sitters). When you select an animation, PMAC handles which animation is played for each user and where to position them and does so based on information stored in a notecard.

Usually animations are supplied in "groups" of animations -- perhaps one group for sitting, one group for lying, another group for cuddling, and so on -- each of which has a number of appropriate animations assigned to it. You pick a group, then pick the animation you want to play from that group.

When you first use PMAC it will already have a default group selected and you'll see the list of animations for that group.  PMAC shows up to 6 animation names, and if there are more than that you can use the PREV and NEXT buttons to scroll through additional pages of them (only the 6 animation names at the top change, the rest of the menu stays the same).

When you pick a new animation the region has to send that to everyone's viewer and some can take longer to arrive than others, so animations that are intended to "fit" together can easily get out of synch the first time you use them. Even if they look fine in your viewer, they might be out of synch for someone else. Pressing the "SYNCH" button tells all of the viewers to restart the current animation from the beginning and should fix that for everyone.

The QUIT button does *almost* what you think it does. QUIT makes *everyone* stand up and stop using the object, not just you. If you want to stop using it but want to leave everyone else seated, simply "stand" using your viewer. Once you do so, PMAC will ignore any button you click on the still-open dialog box so you can either close it or just click any button. The next person who is still seated and touches the object will take control (automatically).

If you want to change to a different group of animations, press the GROUPS button to get a list of the groups you can access. Just like the animation menu, you may need to scroll through pages of them using the PREV and NEXT buttons to find the one you want. When you pick one, you'll be taken back to the animation menu with a list of the animations in the group you selected.

If you accidentally close the dialog menu, just touch the object to have it re-displayed.


**** THE OPTIONS MENU ****

You can enter the options menu by clicking the OPTIONS button on either animation or groups menu pages and what you see will depend a little on who you are and what is currently happening (and how the item has been configured). The buttons on the very top row (EDIT ON and MENUS LOCK/UNLOCK) are only ever visible to the owner. The others can be available to any user. Here's a quick look at each:

QUIT does exactly the same thing as it does in all menus -- everyone is forced to stand.

SYNCH also does exactly the same thing.

BACK  will usually take you back to the animations page unless you're in auto mode in which case it will take you to the groups menu instead.

SWAP let's you move to another position unless the currently playing animtion is only set up for a single user. If the animation is set up for two users you'll immediately swap places (even if there's nobody currently occupying the other spot). If the animation is for any more than two users you'll be asked what position you want to move to and who (if anyone) is currently sitting there. You can't directly make two other people swap places but you could either let one of them take control for a moment, do the swap, then take control back; or you can swap with one, then the other, then again with the first person again and you'll achieve the same thing (it's a little inconvenient, granted, but much simpler on the "behind the scenes" script level to do it that way).

UNSIT allows you to force someone else to stand. Obviously that might not be a very polite thing to do but there are a couple cases where it's useful:
- if the other person has gone AFK for a long time and you simply don't want them standing there
- if one of the other users is an NPC, when you make the NPC stand it will be removed instead, freeing up the spot for someone else to occupy
- if you want to load an animation group that is for a smaller number of users than are currently seated you can make someone stand to free up the spot and allow you to load the new group (be nice about it though...)
If there are only 2 users (yourself and one other) clicking UNSIT will immediately unsit the other user. If there are more, you'll be asked which user you want to force to stand.

ADD NPC allows you to have a vacant position filled by an NPC. The button won't be available if there aren't any empty positions. When you press it you'll be given a list of the NPCs you can load (it's a multi-page list if there are many possible options). Select one and wait a moment for the NPC to rez and join you. To later remove the NPC you can either UNSIT them, or QUIT (which removes all NPCs) or have all "real" users stand -- if there are no avatars still seated all remaining NPCs are removed and the script treats it like a QUIT.

[Slight technical note:
After adding an NPC to the last available vacant position the "ADD NPC" button will often still be shown until you leave the options menu and then return to it, even though there isn't an available position for the NPC to occupy. If you try to add another one you'll be informed that there's no room and the button will update correctly too. This is due to a slight delay in the time it takes an NPC to sit down and be "registered" as a user which is almost always longer than the time it takes to redisplay the options menu. While the script could be changed to "fix" this, it would also mean the menu wouldn't reappear for up to an additional few seconds (and it is already delayed a little by the need to wait for the region to register the NPC) which becomes considerably more annoying than the "phantom" button so I chose to leave this minor "sort-of-bug" instead.]

AUTO takes you to a menu where you can start or stop PMAC's auto mode. AUTO OFF stops it. AUTO ON turns it on using whatever the last selected (or default) time is. Selecting one of the time buttons will turn on auto mode if it isn't already, and use that selected time.

*NEW IN PMAC 2.0* There is also now the built-in ability for PMAC to play through an automatic animation sequence where the time for each animation is different and is controlled by values in PMAC's configuration. The system will probably make it obvious that a group is a sequence and to play it just pick "AUTO ON" rather than specifying a time value. Use "AUTO OFF" to stop at the current animation.

SPECIALS is a button that is only visible if you are using an PMAC add-on that needs to offer you a menu button. If you have one that does, you'll find that button in the list of buttons displayed in the SPECIALS menu. If you have a lot of add-ons the buttons are sorted alphabetically by name and there could be multple pages of them. You'll need to consult your add-on's instructions to find out what their buttons do and sometimes this will temporarily transfer you to a separate menu system controlled directly by the add-on. Once finished, you should be automatically returned to the PMAC menu.

For the curious, there is one additional empty button beside SPECIALS that will always show "-" and be ignored. That's in case there's a need for another button to do something in a future version of PMAC.


**** OWNER-ONLY OPTIONS ****

The very top row of the options menu is only ever displayed for the owner and also contains an empty "-" button that doesn't do anything and is for possible future use. The other two buttons are:

MENUS LOCK/UNLOCK. toggles between allowing other users being allowed to take control and access the menus. If you LOCK menus then only you can ever take control and use them. If you UNLOCK them, anyone who is seated can take control. Be a little cautious with locking menus since PMAC remembers this setting even after you quit. If the user settings don't cause the script to reset on quit, you could accidentally leave everyone locked out of being able to use the controls until you return and unlock if for them. Of course being able to *intentionally* do this is the whole point of having the button there in the first place. Just use with care. :)

EDIT ON is probably the most important button on the entire menu for an owner, but also requires considerably more detailed instructions which aren't suitable for this basic user instructions notecard. Briefly, though, this switches you into edit mode, allowing you to then adjust the positions of each animation and either temporarily or permanently store those changes without ever touching the notecards or doing any copy-pasting. You cannot enter edit mode unless all available positions are occupied -- by avatars or NPCs -- and once in edit mode, you will want to ensure that nobody stands until you've finished and stored your changes. See the Basic Building instructions notecard for complete details.
