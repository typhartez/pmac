This plugin will create a new button in OPTIONS->SPECIAL, called "Give Items".

When you press it (or whoever controls the PMAC in that moment), it'll deliver a folder named like the root prim, with the contents you specify in a notecard.

It can deliver whatever you want and it's fast and easy to setup.

-------

HOW TO SET THINGIES UP:

01.  Create the notecard.

    Create a new notecard, named ".ToGive" (yes, with the period and T and G in upper case, because I'm annoying like that).
    Write in the notecard the name of the items you can give, it can be whatever you want, objects, textures, etc

    ONE
    ITEM
    PER
    LINE

    The best practise is just copy and paste the name of the objects in the notecard, don't add extra spaces.

02. SAVE

    Save the notecard and drop it in your root prim along the rest of the PMAC system.

03. ADD THE THINGS YOU WANT TO GIVE

    Now, add the objects listed in the notecard.

04. ADD THE SCRIPT

    Finally add the script "..addon Content Giver v0.1"

    You -can- add the script first but then the script will whine it can't find the notecard and you will curse me and my family and I don't want that, so don't get creative with the procedure.

05. PROFIT

    Yep that's it, test it, and if it works send me an imaginary kiss or pat in the back and a cigar.
